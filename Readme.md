# Generate drawables

__Applescript for creating Android drawables. The script takes the front-most
document of Photoshop CS3 & the path to your res-folder. Using these, the
script generates an image for all the dpi's and puts it in it's corresponding
directory.__  
_PS. Currently you have to manually ensure that "save for web"-options are
correct. This is due to limited scripting capabilities of CS3._
